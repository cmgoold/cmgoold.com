Repository for my personal website, `<cmgoold.com>`_.

This website is written in Rust, using the
`actix-web <https://actix.rs/>`_ web
framework,
`tera <https://keats.github.io/tera/>`_
for HTML templating, 
and 
`pulldown_cmark <https://github.com/pulldown-cmark/pulldown-cmark>`_
for efficient Markdown parsing.

If you notice any errors,
please open an `issue <https://github.com/cmgoold/cmgoold.com/issues/>`_.
