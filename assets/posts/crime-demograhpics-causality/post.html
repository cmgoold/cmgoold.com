In December, 2025, <em>The Guardian</em> published
an article titled <em><a href=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/dec/14/truth-about-crimes-committed-by-foreign-nationals-uk>Are asylum seekers really more likely to commit violent crime in the UK?</a></em>, which caught my attention.
The article discussed the difficulties with
collecting accurate data on violent crime
incidence rates and immigration status,
and statistically correcting for common causes
like age and sex. 
As is common with these types of articles,
while there is some mention of statistical inference,
the implication was that more accurate data is mainly
what we need to elucidate the relationship between
crime and immigration status.
In a world dominated by the collection and analysis
of data, this concern is completely valid.
However, it misses the arguably more difficult
task of making accurate causal inferences.
Even if the data is as clean as it could
be, we could still easily mislead ourselves by
testing the incorrect causal assumptions.
</p>

<p>
Although it wasn't published, I sent an email,
for the first time,
to <em>The Guardian</em>'s letter section pointing out
that getting the causal reasoning correct is
of as much concern as is collecting accurate data.
In particular, I gave two examples where the causal
inferences are wrong and lead to opposite conclusions,
even when data is uncontaminated.
I won't regurgitate the letter here,
but I will briefly summarise the examples below along with
some example code.
</p>

<p>
I'm sharing this purely from an interest in
statistical inference, not for any political
motivation.
The question
of whether immigration status has any direct
causal effect on crime is immeasurably  
more complex than what I wrote in the letter,
and what I write here in this post.
Any statement that a variable as broad
as immigration status is linked to
crime should cause alarm bells to ring.
At the same time, simple examples can be highly
instructive in checking our causal reasoning. 
As I mentioned in the letter,
inferring any causal effect demands incredible
caution and trained statisticians.
</p>

<h2>Erroneous inference from common causes</h2>

<p>
If sex and age both increase the chances of committing
violent crime and of being an immigrant,
any analysis that does not condition upon
sex and age will find a correlation
between violent crime and immigration
status. The code below simulates some data under
this scenario. Note, I am using a sample of 5000 here
to reduce the noise in estimates later.
</p>

<pre><code class="python">import numpy as np

rng = np.random.default_rng(1234)

def ilogit(x):
  return np.exp(x) / (1 + np.exp(x))

N = 5000
sex = rng.binomial(1, 0.5, size=N)
age = rng.lognormal(np.log(30), 0.2, N)
0
sex_z = sex - 0.5
age_z = (age - age.mean()) / age.std()

immigration = rng.binomial(1, ilogit(sex_z + -0.5 * age_z))
crime = rng.binomial(1, ilogit(-1 + sex_z + -0.5 * age_z))
</code></pre>

<p>I then fit a simple Bernoulli regression model
with <code>crime</code> as the response variable
and a single predictor of <code>immigration</code>.
</p>

<pre><code class="python">
import pymc as pm

with pm.Model() as model:
  alpha = pm.Normal("alpha", 0, 10)
  beta = pm.Normal("beta", 0, 2)
  eta = pm.math.invlogit(alpha + beta * (immigration - 0.5))
  likelihood = pm.Binomial("crime", n=1, p=eta, observed=crime)
  idata = pm.sample(1000, tune=1000, random_seed=rng)
</code></pre>

<p>This model returns a coefficient for
$\beta$ with a mean of 0.41 and a 
95% highest density interval (HDI) of [0.29, 0.53].
After exponentiating to the odds scale,
we'd conclude that being an immigrant
increases the odds of crime by an average
of 51% (95% HDI: [33, 70]).
We know this is wrong, however.
The causal effects come from
the common causes of sex
and age, not any direct effect
of immigration on crime. 
</p>

<p>Adding sex and age as predictor variables
in this model returns a coefficient
for immigration status as covering
zero (mean: -0.01; 95% HDI [-0.14, 0.13])
because the common causes have been accounted
for, and our conclusions would be correct.
</p>

<p>These results are pertinent to any potential
common causes. Sex and age are just two suggestions,
but there are others I'm sure you can think of.
</p>

<h2>Collider bias from conditioning on prisoners</h2>

<p>The second scenario is where only looking
at the prison population induces a collider
bias. A lot of the data used to infer
the relationship between crime and immigration
status come from the prison population and convictions
data.
Specifically, violent crime
and immigration status might both increase
the chances of being in prison.
The first statement is obvious, the second
is more tentative. I don't have data on this personally,
but <em>The Guardian</em> article states that available
data indicates offending
rates might be higher in foreign nationals
than British nationals.
A prior 
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/01/foreigners-underrepresented-among-prisoners-in-england-and-wales-report">article</a>
also wrote that:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
	While non-citizens made up a higher proportion of people 
	convicted for sexual and theft offences over the past decade, 
	researchers cautioned that a lack of data for offenders’ age and 
	sex complicated the picture and meant it was hard to make clear assertions.

</blockquote>

<p>
I'd take this with a grain of salt,
for the exact reasons I am writing this post,
but it seems plausible enough.
For instance, immigrants might be more likely
to engage in other offences due to experiencing
poorer socio-economic conditions or mental health problems. 
In any case, to reiterate, my interest here is purely
the ways in which statistical inference can lead
to erroneous views of causality.
</p>

<p>Here's a simulation of this scenario.
Notice how I am filtering the <code>crime</code> and 
<code>immigration</code> variables for only those
individuals who are in prison.
</p>

<pre><code class="python">immigration = rng.binomial(1, 0.5, size=N)
crime = rng.binomial(1, 0.5, size=N)
prison = rng.binomial(1, ilogit(immigration + 2 * crime))

immigration_in_prison = immigration[prison == 1]
crime_in_prison = crime[prison == 1]

with pm.Model() as model:
  alpha = pm.Normal("alpha", 0, 10)
  beta = pm.Normal("beta", 0, 2)
  eta = pm.math.invlogit(
    alpha + 
    beta * (immigration_in_prison - 0.5)
  )
  likelihood = pm.Binomial(
    "crime", 
    n=1, 
    p=eta, 
    observed=crime_in_prison
  )
  idata = pm.sample(1000, tune=1000, random_seed=rng)
</code></pre>

<p>In this scenario, we find the odds
of violent crime decreases with immigration
status by an average of 25% (95% HDI: [15, 34]).
If we filter for the prison population only,
we condition on the collider,
opening up the path between violent crime and
immigration status. If we don't filter,
then we get an odds ratio of 1.01% (95% HDI: [0.90, 1.12]),
and we'd conclude that there is no direct
effect.
</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

<p>Causal inference is fascinating,
but it's also very troublesome. 
Anyone leading analyses on these complicated
topics are in unenviable positions
of lacking clean or exhaustive-enough data
and the pressures of finding patterns
that could help inform policy.
I only hope that the individuals working
on these topics are trained in causal
inference, and have the humility to know
that the posterior distribution of 
fucking-it-up even with correct data
might not include zero.
