<p>What's so special about domestic dogs?
This has been a long-standing question in
dog behaviour and cognition research.
The obvious answer
is that dogs are highly capable of reading
human behaviour on account of convergent
evolution with humans over some 15,000 
years, or more. Surely, the first
animal to be domesticated by humans,
man's-best-friend, has something to show
for their tolerance of human company
all those years?</p>

<p>A common experimental paradigm to test
domestic dogs' evolved abilities to
read human behaviour is the human pointing
study. Dogs are placed in front of a human,
and the human has bowls of food to their
left and right. Over a number of trials,
humans point to different bowls,
and researchers test the hypothesis
that dogs follow the human point
more often than not to the pointed-to
food bowl.</p>

<p>Where this gets interesting is in
studies that compare dogs and wolves.
In XXXX, it was believed that wolves
performed worse than dogs, in accordance
with the theory that dogs have evolved
specifically to live with humans, and
follow their communicative signals.
But over the last 20 years, this has been
highly debated.
Are dogs genetically-predisposed to perform
better at this task than wolves, or
can their superior performance be explained
by lifestyle factors? Simply, having more
experience living with humans and following
their gestures.
Obviously, one would need to put dogs and
wolves on equal environmental footing to test
this hypothesis properly.

<p>In 2022, Clive Wynne re-analysed data
from a study comparing hand-reared wolves
to dogs on human pointing. The study found
that, despite seemingly equal experience
with humans, dogs still out-performed wolves.
Clive Wynne's reanalysis, however, found that
the authors had not sufficiently 'controlled'
for the time the dog subjects had spent with
human families post-weaning, and including
this effect into the analysis made the differences
between dogs and wolves vanish.</p>

<p>Wynne did not discuss the results in terms
of causality, or causal analysis, but that's
exactly what they demonstrate, and it provides
a simple example of how to think causally
while doing applied statistical analysis.</p>
