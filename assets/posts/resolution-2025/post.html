<p>I've tried starting a blog a number of times,
some of which I hosted and published some
content, others which never got to that
stage. So what's different this time?</p>

<p>While I don't set formal New Year resolutions,
in recent years I have used the turn of the year
as motivation to do something new, albeit small.
Last year was reading 50 books (I read 48).
The year before that was eating more seasonal and
local food. 
This year, I'm going 
to try to maintain this blog, which might be the
most daunting one yet.</p>

<p>This site is written primarily
in <a href=https://www.rust-lang.org>Rust</a>,
using the <a href=https://actix.rs>actix_web</a>
framework. 
<a href=https://keats.github.io/tera/>Tera</a>
is used as a HTML templating engine.
Posts are currently written
in raw HTML.
Post metadata is pulled
in via <a href=https://toml.io/en/>TOML</a>
files. I initially styled the site 
using <a href=https://tailwindcss.com>Tailwindcss</a>,
but reverted to raw CSS after finding
<code>tailwindcss</code> tags had become bloated.
</p>

<p>I followed this great
blog by 
<a href=https://mortenvistisen.com/posts/how-to-build-a-simple-blog-using-rust>Morten Vistisen</a>
for getting started on
piecing the backend and
frontend together.</p>

</p>The design is minimal, and I have tried to
follow good design principles throughout:
pages should be clear and easy to read
on all devices, the navigation bar won't
fool you, the back button works as intended,
links are clearly highlighted
and underlined. The styling, light or dark,
is set depending on your browser's defaults.
If you notice any issues,
