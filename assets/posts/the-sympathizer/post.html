<p>In 2024, I read 48 books, two books short
of my goal for the year. I could have reached
50 books if I'd picked a few
lighter reads in the final couple of weeks of the
year but that felt like an empty road to my goal.
My motivation for setting a reading challenge in the
first place was mostly 
to consume a wider variety of books, not obtain
a particular number per se, and hitting
close to 50 definitely accomplished this.</p>

<p><em>The Sympathizer</em> by Viet Thanh Nguyen
was one of the books I picked up at the
end of the year.
Coming in at 500 pages, although highly
readable, it's packed with historical,
cultural and philosophical references
that I didn't want to skim.
It's a first-person story of 
"a man of two faces": a Vietnamese
army captain and communist spy. The natural
duality inherent in the life of a spy
is a theme that follows the
narrator through opposing political, 
cultural and moral
events and landscapes. 
</p>

<p>One of the things I enjoyed most
about the book was how Nguyen mirrors 
the tumultuous, blood-thirsty events of
the North-South Vietnam war,
the latter communist and the former republican &mdash;
a then colony of the French union &mdash; 
in the narrator's personal combat with
not only their obvious subterfuge
but their mixed heritage and identity, 
loyalty to their childhood
friends who have grown up to be on
very different sides of the revolution, 
and their dysfunctional relationships.
The interweaving of a highly personal
journey with the explanation of
how colonisation and war tore apart
Vietnamese lives and families,
a topic I didn't know that much about,
was very rewarding.
</p>

<p>The events in the book culminate with
the following insight:</p>

<blockquote>
    [W]hile nothing is more precious than than
    independence and freedom, <em>nothing is more
    precious than independence and freedom!</em>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't think I'm spoiling much by including
this quote. A sign of a good book, for me,
is one that sticks with me afterwards, one
that might be frustrating because I don't
feel like I 100% understood every theme or choice
the author took, but
yet I don't feel satisfied to just forget and
move on.
The quote above is what has stuck with me
from this book.
